# Logbook (LogMD) — engine

Shared spec for every `logbook` skill except the four self-contained ones — the synthesis
three (`/logbook:ingest`, `/logbook:query`, `/logbook:lint`) and the authoring
four (`/logbook:guide`, `/logbook:runbook`, `/logbook:document`,
`/logbook:walkthrough`). **Each of those reads this file first**, then runs its
workflow. Everything common — where the contract lives, which tools to use, the
layers, the watermark — is here once; the skills hold only their own steps. The
other four are self-contained on purpose, because reading three spec files
first is a cost none of them would earn back: `/logbook:entry` (the capture gate,
fired from a commit hook), `/logbook:task` (the pending-work board),
`/logbook:run` (executes the job a note describes, recording the outcome in that
note) and `/logbook:template` (designs a reusable note shape). None reads this
file.

`/logbook:entry` captures work as immutable per-invocation notes, but capture is
write-only: notes pile up, they never come back synthesized. The synthesis three
are the read layer on top. Raw stays messy on purpose; the wiki is the ordered
layer, and the agent — not the human — keeps it ordered.

The authoring four are a different job: they **write a document that did not
exist as a document anywhere**, into `guides/`, `runbooks/`, `docs/` and
`flows/`, from sources verified in the run rather than from the session's own
context. Their shared spec — the evidence rule, the four evidence channels, the
skeleton, the closing loop — is `AUTHORING.md`, which they read after this file
and after the vault's `wiki/CLAUDE.md`.

**Vault paths, not skill names.** The raw layer is `entries/` and the synthesized
one `wiki/`; `logbook` is the name of the tooling and never a path. `entries/` was
`bitacora/` until 2026-09-06 — a folder `move` carried all 199 notes and rewrote
the inbound links, so nothing outside these docs still says the old name.

Pattern: **the vault is the source of truth, the LLM is a processing layer.** The
knowledge should *compound*, not just accumulate.

## The contract lives in the vault, not here

**Read `wiki/CLAUDE.md` (in the vault) before every workflow.** It is the per-vault
config and it **outranks this file** on everything it covers: the type vocabulary,
the frontmatter fields, the repo-tag alias table, the index and log formats, the
external-research procedure, the human/agent split, the cadence. This file is the
engine; that one is the configuration, and it is versioned inside the vault so it
travels with the content rather than with this plugin.

If `wiki/CLAUDE.md` is missing you are pointed at the wrong project — stop and say
so. Do **not** bootstrap a replacement from memory: a hand-written contract that
disagrees with 200 existing documents is worse than no contract.

Two things it defers to in turn:

- **OKF semantics** — `/logbook:okf`, this plugin's own skill (`skills/okf/SKILL.md`).
  It carries OKF v0.2: reserved files, the open type vocabulary, provenance
  (`generated` vs `verified`, ISO 8601 with an explicit UTC offset), `sources`, and
  what the server's `okf` diagnostics mean. Read it instead of re-deriving the spec
  here. This engine only records where *this* vault deliberately sits: it still
  carries the legacy `timestamp` field rather than v0.2 `generated.at`, and
  migrating a page is a decision, not a cleanup — never invent provenance for a page
  you did not generate.
- **The `.ok/okf/*.schema.json` files** in the vault, for exact field contracts.
  Generated; read them, never edit them. A vault the logmd server initialized
  carries only `required`, `reserved-index` and `root-index`; the others exist only
  where a vault brought them along.

## Tools: use the MCP, not the filesystem

The vault is remote: a logmd server, reached through the `logbook-mcp` MCP server this
plugin registers. There is no local copy, so `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` cannot reach it at
all — and even where a vault is on disk, the native tools skip the frontmatter,
backlinks and attribution that `exec` returns per file. The mapping:

| Need | Tool |
|---|---|
| List, `cat`, `grep`, `find` over the vault | `exec` (read-only allowlist, one pipe per call) |
| Ranked lookup by title/body | `search` (`query`; lexical BM25 + recency, no semantic signal) |
| Create a document | `write` (`document`, or `documents` for a batch) |
| Change part of one | `edit` (`find`/`replace`, or a `frontmatter` merge-patch) |
| A folder's title, description and tags | `folder` (`frontmatter` merge-patch; creates the folder) |
| Backlinks, forward links, dead, orphans, hubs, suggest | `links` (one `kind`, or an array) |
| Broken links + lint violations in one pass | `audit` |
| Lint one doc, optionally auto-fix | `lint` (`fix: true` with `document`) |
| Who wrote a version, and when | `history` |
| A restore point, and going back to one | `checkpoint`, `restore_version` |
| Point the reader at what matters in a page | `highlight` (`quote`s or `heading`s, each with a `kind` and a `note`) |

**`write` with `position: replace` overwrites the entire body.** That is correct
for a document that does not exist yet and destructive for one that does — it is
how this vault lost its `log.md` once. The server refuses a `write` with `content`
at a live path unless a `position` is named, so the destructive write always has
to be asked for by name; when it happens the response's `advisories` say how many
bytes it replaced. To change an existing page use `edit`; to add to one, `write`
with an explicit `append`/`prepend`, or `edit` against a unique anchor.
`frontmatter` passed to `write` is merged into what the page already has, never a
replacement for it.

**Read the response, not just its `ok`.** `write` and `edit` return `warnings` for
what landed but will not render — a `mermaid-parse-error` names the line of a
fence mermaid cannot draw. The write is not refused for it, so nothing else will
tell you.

**Write a page to be scanned, not only read.** A person reads these in the LogMD
app, which draws GitHub/Obsidian callouts as coloured boxes. A page longer than a
screen opens with a `> [!SUMMARY]` callout — two to four lines with the conclusion.
Decisions, risks and next steps sit where they occur in `> [!IMPORTANT]`,
`> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`, `> [!TIP]` or `> [!NOTE]` (text after the marker is
the box's title). Sections of a screen or less under `##`/`###`; paragraphs of a few
sentences; parallel facts as a list; anything with attributes — options, costs,
owners — as a table. `write` and `edit` answer with `suggestions` when a page falls
short of this (`no-summary`, `wall-of-text`, `long-section`, `list-as-table`,
`no-highlight`): act on them with `edit` before moving on. Log entries are raw
capture and keep their own shape; they are never asked for a summary.

**Finish a long page by pointing at it, not by asking for it to be read.** After
writing or reworking anything the user has to review — a document, a walkthrough, a
plan, a research note — call `highlight` on it with the few places that matter: the
conclusion (`important`), the decision they must take (`decision`), what is still
open (`question`), what comes next (`next`), each with a one-sentence `note`. The app
marks them in the note and steps the reader through them. A `quote` is exact body
text within one paragraph, a `heading` covers its section; if one misses, nothing is
set and the error says which. It replaces the page's earlier highlights and changes
nothing in the page itself.

**Paths under `.ok/` are not documents.** `write` and `edit` refuse them: a
folder's own frontmatter goes through `folder`, a template through
`template_write` — a folder template too, with `files` and `stages` — and a new
folder is made from a folder template with `folder_from_template`.

`exec` is read-only and is **not a shell**: one command or one pipe, no `&&`, no
`;`, no redirection, and no backtick, `$(` or `${` anywhere — not even inside
quotes. Several things = several calls.

## The layers

Authoritative list is `wiki/CLAUDE.md`; this is the shape, so a workflow knows what
it may write to.

- **Raw — immutable. Read, never edit, never move.**
  - `entries/*` — the active gate: one file per invocation, written by
    `/logbook:entry`.
  - `claude_sessions/*` — frozen legacy raw, from before the bitácora. Ingested,
    never appended to; two entry gates produce drift.
- **`sources/*`** — external material captured verbatim (`type: source`), immutable
  after capture, so pages cite a local document and never the live web. Analysis
  does not go here.
- **`specs/*`** — feature specs agreed before implementing.
- **`wiki/<topic>`** — the synthesized layer, one page per concept / service /
  decision / entity / repo. This is the only layer the synthesis skills write to,
  plus `wiki/index.md` and `wiki/log.md`.
- **The authored layers**, one skill each, all four written from verified sources
  under `AUTHORING.md` and never from the session's context:
  - `guides/<topic>` (`type: guide`) — reference and usage, the *what* you consult
    while working. `/logbook:guide`.
  - `runbooks/<repo>-<topic>` (`type: runbook`) — ordered procedures with
    per-step verification and an undo. `/logbook:runbook`.
  - `docs/<topic>` (`type: document`) — the long form: design docs, architecture,
    deep analysis. `/logbook:document`, which bootstraps the folder on first use.
  - `flows/<repo>-<process>` (`type: flow`) — one process traced through the code
    it really executes, as mermaid diagrams whose every node carries a
    `file:line` anchor, pinned to a commit SHA so the page can be **re-verified
    mechanically** later. `/logbook:walkthrough`, which bootstraps the folder.

  The *why* behind any of them stays on the `wiki/` page, linked, never copied.
  All four keep a hand-written `index.md` and prepend to `wiki/log.md` like the
  synthesis skills do.
- **`tasks/<repo>`** (`type: task-board`) — the one **mutable, stateful** layer:
  a per-repo board of pending work, `## Open` / `## Done`, written by
  `/logbook:task`, whatever the work came out of. Everything else here is either immutable (raw, sources) or a
  document that is revised; a board is state that flips. Hence its rules differ:
  it is **always `edit`, never `write`** at a live path, a task is never deleted
  (dropping is a recorded outcome), and it does **not** prepend to `wiki/log.md`
  — a board edit is not a vault operation.

## Links

Standard markdown links in the **relative** form — `[service-x](./service-x.md)`,
`[note](../entries/….md)`. The reason is portability: a relative link still
resolves on GitHub, in Obsidian, in VS Code and on a published site, none of which
know where this vault's content root is.

The root-absolute form (`/folder/x.md`, leading slash = content root) is equally
valid to logmd — and the one OKF itself recommends — and handy across folders. **The rule is that the two never
mix**: prefixing `./` to a root-style path from a document already inside that
folder duplicates the segment (`wiki/wiki/x.md`) and the link dies silently. This
vault picks the relative form and holds it everywhere, which is what makes that
failure unreachable rather than merely rare — so a root-absolute link here is
wrong for consistency, not because the form is invalid.

A page with no backlink to the raw note(s) it synthesizes is unfinished.

Links are not decoration here. logmd retrieval is a **lexical loop** —
BM25 plus recency plus graph traversal, with semantic search off — so links,
folders, titles and folder descriptions *are* the index. Every link shortens the
next agent's loop.

### A folder's description carries its rule, not just its name

Each layer's `.ok/frontmatter.yml` holds a `title`, a `description` and `tags`,
set with the `folder` tool, and the agent reads that description **on every listing
of the folder** — before
any contract file, and whether or not it ever opens one. So the description is
where a layer's discipline belongs, in one line and in the imperative:
`entries/` says it is immutable and one file per invocation, `sources/` that it
is verbatim capture with no analysis, `tasks/` that it is edited and never
written. That places the rule closest to the action instead of relying on
`wiki/CLAUDE.md` having been read — which `/logbook:entry` and `/logbook:task`
never do.

## index.md and log.md

Both are hand-written and reserved. `wiki/index.md` lists **every** page in the
folder, reusing each page's own `description` verbatim as its one-liner — a partial
index makes pages unreachable for anyone reading the bundle without listing the
directory. `wiki/log.md` is **newest-first**, one `## YYYY-MM-DD: <op> | <summary>`
heading per operation.

**Nothing generates them.** logmd has no index generator, so an index is only
as complete as the last workflow that closed its loop — which is why every
workflow that adds a page updates the folder's `index.md` in the same run. Both are
reserved by OKF (§3.1): they need no `type`, and an `index.md` below the vault root
carries no frontmatter at all.

### The watermark

The most recent **ingest** entry in `wiki/log.md` carries the source range it
processed, and that range **is** the processed marker — it replaces moving files
into a `processed/` folder, which is what keeps the raw immutable. "Since the last
ingest" = every `entries/` note whose timestamp is **≥** the end of that range
(inclusive). Because each note is one immutable file whose name sorts
chronologically, a note that appears after an ingest is always a *new* file with a
later name — never an edit to one already read — so nothing falls in the crack the
old one-file-per-day model had. Re-reading the boundary minute is a safe no-op:
page writes integrate facts, they don't duplicate them.

## Language

**English, everywhere, since 2026-09-06** — every path segment the vault creates
(folders, files, page slugs, template names) and all new prose. The vault's own
`wiki/CLAUDE.md` carries the rule; it outranks this file if the two ever drift.

**The synthesized layers were translated on 2026-09-06** — every `wiki/` page, its
contract and index, plus `guides/`, `runbooks/`, `specs/`, the folder descriptions
and both templates. What stays Spanish is what cannot be rewritten without
destroying its value: the 199 `entries/` notes and the `sources/` captures (raw and
immutable), `claude_sessions/` (frozen), and `wiki/log.md` — append-only history
whose ingest watermarks are read out of it. Tags moved with their pages, so a wiki
tag no longer matches the raw one; `wiki/CLAUDE.md` carries the equivalence table
`ingest` and `lint` need to slice across both.

Translate a page whole or not at all — a half-translated one is worse than a
consistent one. **When you rename for this rule, use `move`**: it rewrites the
inbound links in the same pass, which is the only reason the rule is affordable.
