name: task
description: Capture, list and close pending work on a per-repo board (tasks/<repo>, type task-board) in the Logbook vault, with enough context to pick it up cold and a code anchor confirmed against the real code when the task is technical. Use when the user says "task", "tarea", "pendiente", "apunta esto", "queda pendiente", "/logbook:task", describes work to do later, or wants to see or close what is open.

# logbook · task

Deliberately **self-contained**, like `/logbook:entry`: everything needed is
below, and reading three spec files before writing one task line is a cost the
skill would never earn back. Read the plugin root's `ENGINE.md` (two directories
above this SKILL.md) only when something here is ambiguous.

**Pending work, wherever it comes from** — something you decided to defer,
something the review turned up, something agreed with someone else, something
planned for later, something you noticed and did not want to lose. The board
holds it with enough context to pick it up cold, weeks later, without the
session that filed it.

Three operations, one verb:

| You want to | You type |
|---|---|
| Capture a pending item | `/logbook:task <whatever it is>` |
| See what is open | `/logbook:task list [repo]` |
| Close or drop one | `/logbook:task done <which>` / `drop <which>` |

## Where

**`tasks/<repo>.md`** — one board per repository, `type: task-board`, written
through the `logbook-mcp` MCP. `<repo>` is the repository slug, bare, the same
one `/logbook:entry` uses.

- **Never `write` at a board that exists.** `write` with `position: replace`
  destroys the whole body — every open task on it. Boards change constantly, so
  **the board is always `edit`**; `write` is only for creating one that is not
  there.
- **Bootstrap on demand**: if `tasks/` is absent, create it with the `folder` tool
  (`frontmatter` with the folder's `title` / `description` / `tags` — `write` refuses
  paths under `.ok/`) and a hand-written `tasks/index.md` listing every board. A new repo's board starts as the two
  headings, `## Open` and `## Done`, and nothing else.
- **MCP down → say so and stop.** No `curl`, no writing the task to a local file
  "for later". A pending item that only exists in this session's context is
  exactly the thing this skill exists to prevent.

## Capturing

**Keep it cheap.** You are filing a task, not starting it — do not begin fixing
the thing, and do not turn a one-line capture into an investigation.

### 1. Is it technical?

**Technical** means it points at code that exists. Then it gets an anchor, and
the anchor gets **confirmed before it is written**:

- Open the file and read the lines. Do not file from recollection or from what
  was said earlier in the session — that is how a board fills with tasks about
  code that was already fixed, or about a symbol that never had that name.
- Record `path:line` **relative to the repo root**, the symbol, and the commit:
  `git rev-parse --short HEAD`. The anchor is true at that SHA and claims nothing
  about later.
- **If confirming would take more than a quick look, file it as unverified** with
  the exact question to answer — and say so in the chat. A bounded capture that
  says "unverified" beats an accurate one that cost twenty minutes. This is the
  one place the plugin's evidence rule is deliberately capped: the check must
  stay cheaper than the task it is describing.

**Non-technical** — something agreed with someone, a decision waiting on a
person, a process item, a follow-up from a review. No anchor, and the board says
so. Record **who raised it and when** where there is a who: a task with no origin
is one nobody can chase. If it *is* checkable against code and you have not
checked it, that is an unverified claim and gets written as one, with what to
check.

### 2. Write it

One `edit` on the board, inserting **right under `## Open`** — a stable anchor
that survives two sessions capturing at once, which a line-number-based insert
does not.

```markdown
- [ ] **Retries are not idempotent** · `2026-09-08`
  - **Where**: `internal/queue/worker.go:88` @ `a1b2c3d` — `Worker.process`
    re-enqueues with no dedup key
  - **Why it matters**: a redelivery double-charges the customer
  - **Origin**: deferred while tracing the invoice flow
```

- The checkbox line is the scannable layer: a **bold title that names the
  problem**, not the fix, plus the date.
- **Where** — anchor + SHA + symbol, or `unverified —` and what to check.
- **Why it matters** — the consequence. A task with no consequence gets deferred
  forever and should probably be dropped now instead.
- **Origin** — where it came from, in a few words: `deferred while <doing what>`,
  `from the review of <PR>`, `agreed with <who>, <date>`, `planned for <when>`.
- Link out when it helps: the `wiki/` page, the flow, the `entries/` note from
  the session it came out of. Relative links only.

**One task per item.** Two problems in one checkbox is one that never gets
closed.

## Listing

`exec` and read — this is a plain read, keep it cheap:

- One repo: `cat tasks/<repo>.md`.
- Everything open, across repos: `grep -n "^- \[ \]" tasks/`.
- Report **open first**, grouped by repo, oldest first — age is the signal. Say
  out loud which ones carry a stale-looking anchor (an old SHA on a file that has
  moved on) rather than presenting them all as equally live.

## Closing

Closing on belief is how a board stops being trusted. **Check first, then close:**

- **Technical** — re-read the anchor. Is the problem actually gone? If the file
  moved or the symbol was renamed, find it before deciding. `git log --oneline
  <sha>..HEAD -- <anchor path>` shows what touched it since the task was filed.
- **Non-technical** — say what actually happened, and who confirmed it where
  somebody did. "No longer needed" is a valid close and a different one from
  "done"; both beat a checkbox flipped with no reason.

Then **one `edit`**: flip `- [ ]` to `- [x]`, move the whole block under
`## Done`, and append a closing line — the date, and the commit that closed it or
the reason it was dropped.

```markdown
  - **Closed**: 2026-09-14, fixed in `9f3750f` — dedup key on the message id
```

**Dropping is a real outcome and gets the same treatment.** A task dropped with
its reason recorded is knowledge; one silently deleted is a decision nobody can
review. Never delete a task line.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **It does not fix the task.** Capture and close only.
- **It does not write to `entries/`, `wiki/`, `sources/` or the authored
  layers.** When a task is closed by real work, `/logbook:entry` records that
  work and this board records the close — two different files, cross-linked.
- **It does not touch `wiki/log.md`.** That log tracks vault operations
  (ingest / lint / query); a board edit is not one.

## Language

**English on the board**, whatever language the session is in — same rule as the
repo and the rest of the vault. Chat replies follow the user.
